# SmartCities

The availability of widely adopted (de-facto standard) information models is key for creating a global digital single market of interoperable and replicable (portable) IoT-enabled smart solutions for smart cities. Such models provide an essential element in the common technical ground needed for standards-based open innovation and procurement.

Data Models play a crucial role because they define the harmonised representation formats and semantics that will be used by applications both to consume and to publish data.

The FIWARE Foundation, TM Forum, OASC and  IUDX are leading a joint collaboration program to support the adoption of compatible common data models that underpin a digital market of interoperable and replicable smart solutions in multiple sectors, starting with smart cities.

This respository contains a list of subjects (groups of data models) for managing different aspects of smart cities. The models can be extended if real uses cases are provided and definitions according to the principles of <a href="https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/MANIFESTO.md">agile standardization</a>. Best place to start is the <a href="https://smartdatamodels.org">main site</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/MANIFESTO.md">contribution manual</a>.

Cities have a wealth of possible data sources, such as ticket sales on public transport, local tax information, police reports, local weather stations, waste management facilities and traffic information. Some now also have a wealth of information from photos and videos, where AI pattern recognition can be applied for improving traffic congestion and reducing crime.

In cities, internet of things (IoT) data is prevalent. Forrester Research predicts that IoT will become the backbone of customer value as it continues to grow. Early leaders in IoT are retailers who are using it to create intimate customer experience, with healthcare and supply chain not far behind. They are using IoT to connect with patients via wearable devices and track products from factory to floor.
